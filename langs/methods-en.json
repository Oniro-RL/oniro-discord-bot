        "desc": "The acronym WBTB refers to the English expression \"Wake - Back To Bed\". It is the act of getting up earlier than usual at night or in the morning, staying awake for a certain amount of time and then going back to sleep again. During this awakened time an induction method (ideally a MILD) can be used, but WBTB is not an induction method alone, it is only a special arrangement of sleep time."

        "desc": "MILD is a fairly easy to access induction method that makes it possible to become lucid during a normal dream. It was invented by Stephen LaBerge when he sought to increase his frequency of lucid dreams for the preparation of his doctorate. He believes that this is the most effective method with reality testing."

        "desc": "The WILD (Wake Induced Lucid Dream or Wake Initiated Lucid Dream) is a lucid dream obtained through conscious sleep, that is to say, one consciously crosses the steps between the state of sleep and sleep to find oneself inside the dream. We will thus have witnessed his own falling asleep and the birth of the dream, without losing consciousness."

        "desc": "MUO means Maintenance in the Oniric Universe. It is simply a matter of going back to sleep right after a dream to \"go back\". During a dream (clear or unclear), it can happen that you wake up suddenly. The MUO consists of going back to sleep as soon as you are conscious of waking up. To do this, you must not move, and keep your eyes closed, until you go back to sleep."
